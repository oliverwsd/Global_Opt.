Python for global optimierung
### Sonder√ºbung
In S2 we created the algorithmus based on the FW-algo and compare the running time with the Standardsolver from Scipy 
The result is stunning, as the data grows rapidly, there's a huge time difference between FW and Scipy
FW is easy constructed and as its largest disadvantage, it acquire more and more time to get result as data scale grows.
However, Standardsolver from Scipy remains a high level of performance, no matter the size of data.

In S3 we focus on the interval hull and the box width in accordance with interval functions.
Slightly differnt ways of explaination may lead to significant differences in time and value, especially when handling with big data.
